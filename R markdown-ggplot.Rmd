## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(esquisse)

data(mpg)
force(mpg)
View(mpg)
attach(mpg)

#1.What is the relationship between engine displacement and vehicle mileage? 

#From the graph, it appears that there is strong negative correlation
#between engine displacement and vehicle mileage

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) +
  geom_point(color = "#0c4c8a") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
